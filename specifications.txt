## 1   Frame the problem and opportunity  

| Signal | What it tells you |
|--------|------------------|
| Reddit threads complaining that “sve je scam” (“everything is a scam”) and that fake iPad ads dominate the site. citeturn2search1 | Real pain‑point: users have lost faith in listing quality. |
| Njuškalo’s own help‑desk posts teaching users how to spot phishing links. citeturn2search4 | Even the incumbent admits the issue. |
| EU Digital Services Act (DSA) now applies to **all** marketplaces since 17 Feb 2024, adding strict duties to remove illegal content and vet sellers. citeturn0search4 | Compliance is no longer optional: whoever solves safety best wins. |

**Opportunity:** A “verified‑first, escrow‑by‑default” marketplace aimed at Croatian users who are tired of playing scam whack‑a‑mole.

## 2   Regulatory & compliance checklist (non‑negotiable)

| Domain | Key rules you must meet from day 1 |
|--------|------------------------------------|
| **Digital Services Act** | • Designated point of contact for authorities and users  
• Notice‑and‑action flow for illegal listings  
• Transparent annual risk reports |
| **GDPR** | Explicit consent for marketing mails/SMS; clear data‑retention schedule. citeturn0search1 |
| **Croatian Consumer Protection Act (2022 update)** | Must show trader/consumer status on each listing and honor 14‑day withdrawal rights for traders. citeturn0search3 |
| **Payment Services / AML (PSD2)** | If you hold money in escrow you’re a “payment institution” or need a licensed partner (e‑money or banking‑as‑a‑service). |

*Takeaway:* Loop a local law firm in early; it‘s cheaper than retro‑fitting later.

## 3   Product pillars that differentiate you

| Pillar | Concrete feature ideas |
|--------|-----------------------|
| **Real‑ID seller onboarding** | Bank‑level KYC via Croatia’s e‑Građani eID or video‑KYC SDK (Onfido, SumSub). Users see a “Verified” badge; unverified accounts can only browse. |
| **Escrow & shipping in one flow** | Buyer pays into an in‑app wallet; funds release only when courier scan confirms delivery or buyer clicks “Everything OK”. |
| **Fraud defense stack** | • ML model flags duplicate images/text and sudden price drops  
• Velocity rules (max 3 high‑risk listings per hour)  
• Human review queue integrated with Admin dashboard |
| **Transparency & recourse** | • One‑tap “Report listing” that must be actioned within 48 h (DSA)  
• Public dashboard of takedown stats builds trust. |
| **User education** | Onboarding quiz: “Spot the scam” examples; you can’t post until you pass. |

## 4   MVP scope and architecture

### 4.1 Functional cut‑off (90‑day goal)

1. **Core flows**  
   - Post listing (title, photos, price, category)  
   - Search & filter + Chat (real‑time)  
   - KYC + escrow checkout + shipping label print

2. **Platforms**  
   - **Web PWA** (Next.js 14)  
   - **Mobile**: React Native wrapper or go full Swift/Kotlin later.

3. **Backend**  
   ```
   API‑Gateway (NestJS)
       ├─ Auth & KYC svc        (Postgres)
       ├─ Listings svc          (Postgres + S3/GCS)
       ├─ Search svc            (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch)
       ├─ Chat & Notifications  (Redis + WebSocket)
       └─ Payments svc          (Adyen / Stripe Treasury)
   ```

4. **Ops**  
   - Docker‑ized micro‑services on Fly.io or Kubernetes (Hetzner)  
   - CI/CD pipeline triggering Cypress e2e tests

### 4.2 Delivery timeline (team of 4)

| Week | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1‑2 | User interviews, clickable Figma, legal gap‑analysis |
| 3‑5 | Auth, KYC flow, Postgres schema, image upload |
| 6‑7 | Search, listing page, chat MVP |
| 8‑9 | Escrow checkout, courier API (Hrvatska Pošta + DPD) |
| 10 | Fraud‑rules engine v1 + admin console |
| 11 | Private beta with 100 users in Zagreb |
| 12 | Hardening, DSA transparency page → public launch |

## 5   Operational playbook for trust & safety

1. **Pre‑listing**  
   - Real‑time image hashing against known scam hashes.  
   - Auto‑price checker alerts seller if price is 40 % below market median.

2. **Post‑listing monitoring**  
   - NLP classifier scans messages for phishing links.  
   - “Three‑strikes” system auto‑suspends repeat offenders.

3. **Payments & disputes**  
   - Dispute portal with 7‑day SLA; escrow partner can reverse funds.  
   - Optional return shipping label auto‑generated.

## 6   Go‑to‑market & monetisation

| Phase | Growth loop | Revenue |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Beta (invite‑only) | University & tech‑meetup codes → create social proof | Free |
| Public launch | Referral credits (both sides) | 5 % escrow fee + paid “Top Listing” |
| Scale (year 2) | Partnership with Hrvatska Pošta pick‑up lockers; TV ads | Pro shop subscriptions + API for ERP bulk upload |

### Final thought

Njuškalo’s network effect is strong, but **network trust** is brittle—exactly where you can out‑execute.  Ship a slim, legally solid MVP that **cannot** be used without real identity and escrow, learn from those first 100 sellers, and iterate.

Let me know when you want to zoom in on any phase (e.g., KYC vendors or shipping APIs), and we’ll dig deeper.  Sretno s izgradnjom! 🛠️
